## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea:
Proposed Solution: AI-Powered Interview Evaluation System
1. Virtual Board Room Experience
A simulated interview environment that mirrors real-life boardroom settings.
Multi-panel setup where experts can interact with candidates in a structured way.
AI-driven moderator to ensure the interview stays on track.
2. Structured Interview Flow
Ice-Breaking Questions: AI generates personalized introduction questions based on the candidate's background.
Techno-Managerial Questions: Dynamic questioning based on the candidate’s expertise and position level.
Adaptive Questioning: AI adjusts question difficulty based on candidate responses.
3. Relevance Scoring Mechanism
Expert Question Relevance Scoring: AI evaluates the interviewer’s questions for alignment with the candidate's expertise.
Candidate Response Grading: AI assesses response relevance based on keywords, depth, and coherence.
4. Quantifiable Scoring System
Expert Score: Based on how relevant their questions are.
Candidate Score: Based on technical accuracy, managerial insight, and articulation.
Final Suitability Score: Weighted combination of candidate responses, question relevance, and expertise match.
5. AI & NLP Integration
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and evaluate responses.
Machine learning to refine question generation and scoring over time.
Pattern recognition to identify top-performing candidates.
6. Report Generation & Insights
Auto-generated evaluation reports summarizing candidate performance.
Comparison charts for multiple candidates.
Suggested areas for improvement.
